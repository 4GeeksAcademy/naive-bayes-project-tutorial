# Naive Bayes Project Tutorial
<!-- endhide -->

- In this project we should follow the instructions carefully because this is a brief introduction to NLP and how to deal with semtniment analysis. 

- Of course, we'll handle it with Naive Bayes. 

- We'll have the opportunity to go deeper with sentiment analysis and NLP in its own future lesson.


## üå±  How to start this project

You will not be forking this time, please take some time to read this instructions:

1. Create a new repository based on [machine learning project](https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/machine-learning-python-template/generate) by [clicking here](https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/machine-learning-python-template).
2. Open the recently created repostiroy on Gitpod by using the [Gitpod button extension](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/browser-extension/).
3. Once Gitpod VSCode has finished opening you start your project following the Instructions below.

## üöõ How to deliver this project

Once you are finished creating your naive bayes model, make sure to commit your changes, push to your repository and go to 4Geeks.com to upload the repository link.


## üìù Instructions

**Naive sentiment analysis**

This is a simple project using Naive Bayes Classifier and Scikit-learn to create a Google Play store reviews classifier (Sentiment Analysis) in Python. You will categorize user reviews as good or bad. The Naive Bayes classification technique is a simple and powerful classification task in machine learning. The Naive Bayes classification technique is a simple and powerful classification task in machine learning. In this dataset, we use the 23 most popular mobile apps, and only two columns.

**Step 1:**

We have three columns: package name, review and polarity (0 = bad, 1 = good)

**Step 2:**

Preprocess the data and use Naive Bayes to classify the reviews as good or bad.

**Step 3:**

Use the app.py to create your new pipeline. 

Save your naive bayes classification model in the 'models' folder.

In your README file write a brief summary.
